Revision history for Net-Async-HTTP

0.25    BUGFIXES:
         * Defend against ->setsockopt detecting SvPOK() of string values
         * Test for both "Connection closed" and "Connection closed while
           awaiting header" as OSes differ in behaviour

0.24    CHANGES:
         * Optionally set IP_TOS field in sockets
         * Remember to pass 'SSL' parameter around for requests on 'https'
           scheme

0.23    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix t/14conn-max.t failures - disable pipelining, wait for correct
           peersock connection to become ready (it may not be [0])

0.22    CHANGES:
         * Allow more control over per-host concurrency; either a pool with a
           limit, or boundless growth of concurrency

0.21    CHANGES:
         * Optional mode in which 4xx and 5xx HTTP errors are turned into
           callback errors or Future failures
         * Handle incoming 1xx informational responses
         * Optionally set 'Expect' header for 100 Continue response

0.20    CHANGES:
         * Improvements to timeout and cancellation handling
         * Updated for Future 0.12; pass 'return' argument to
           Future::Utils::repeat
         * Use newer IO::Async::OS->socketpair in unit tests

0.19    CHANGES:
         * Allow $http->do_request to return a Future object yielding the
           eventual response
         * Added convenient $http->GET and ->HEAD methods
         * Many internal neatenings and rewrites to better support Futures

0.18    CHANGES:
         * Default host/port/SSLness from URL in HTTP::Request if given
         * Set Connection: keep-alive by default
         * Presume that HTTP/1.1 connections can keep-alive by default
         * Attempt to limit the number of outstanding requests in flight per
           connection; keep others in a queue

        BUGFIXES:
         * Pass the same timer object down redirects so the same overall
           timeout is reused
         * Fix memory leak by remembering to remove closed NaHTTP::Protocol
           children from containing NaHTTP
         * Correctly terminate requests to connections closed during write
         * Handle trailing whitespace after Chunked encoding chunk size
           (thanks David Leadbeater)

0.17    CHANGES:
         * Support optionally setting local host/port/addr (RT75431)
         * Don't pipeline requests until the server is known to be at least
           HTTP/1.1

        BUGFIXES:
         * Default request protocol to HTTP/1.1 so caller doesn't have to
           (RT75830)
         * http(s) port logic on numbers rather than protocol names (RT75615)
         * Use more weaseling in timeout handlers to avoid cyclic reference
           memory leak

0.16    BUGFIXES:
         * Work around HTTP::Message's non-trimming of linear whitespace
           (RT72843)

0.15    BUGFIXES:
         * Better HTTP handling of "Connection: close" connections; close the
           socket at the end of the response body or HEAD header.

0.14    CHANGES:
         * Per-request timeouts
         * Default port to http/https if not supplied explicitly
         * Fill in Response ->previous on redirects - RT72791
         * Improvements to unit tests

0.13    BUGFIXES:
         * Handle redirect to https:// as well as http:// (RT71526)
         * Fix use of conditional variable declaration that breaks on
           Perl 5.14 (RT71545)
         * Clean up connection cache after resolve, connect or SSL failures
           (RT71530)

0.12    BUGFIXES:
         * Wait for connect to complete when pipelining multiple requests down
           the same connection initially (RT66189)
         * When serialising a request, handle a full protocol://authority URI
           by splitting protocol/authority parts out of it

0.11    BUGFIXES:
         * Fix stalling t/12request-streaming.t test script that causes lots
           of FAILs at test time

0.10    CHANGES:
         * Support streaming of request body content
         * Support HTTP::Cookies object as a cookie jar
         * Allow proxy_host and proxy_port as ->configure parameters, to set
           defaults for requests

0.09    CHANGES:
         * Use IO::Async::Protocol->connect from 0.34

0.08    CHANGES:
         * Support streaming of response body content
         * Support SSL if IO::Async::SSL is installed

0.07    CHANGES:

         * Created example wget-style script
         * Documentation neatening

         * Added 'use warnings'
         * Updated to IO::Async 0.21 style
         * Various small documentation and test script updates
