=pod

A slightly longer example demonstrating multiple L<Net::Async::HTTP> clients running in parallel. Given a base URL,
this will recursively (breadth-first) scan any paths given on the command line and PUT whatever files are found.

The resulting file structure will be flattened, there's no attempt to MKCOL the equivalent path structure on the
target server.

@ARGV || die <<"USAGE";
Net::Async::HTTP PUT client example.

Usage:

 $0 [-u user:pass] -n 8 http://dav.example.com file*.txt directory1 directory2

If -u options are given, these will be sent as Basic auth credentials. Different ports can be specified in the URL,
e.g. http://example.com:12314/file.txt.

The -n option specifies how many parallel connections to open (default is a single connection only).

USAGE

my $loop = IO::Async::Loop->new();

# Bytes transferred so far
my $total = 0;

# Define some workers
$opts{n} ||= 1;

# Used for pretty-printing, not essential if you don't have it installed
my $fhb = Format::Human::Bytes->new;

# The clients are added to this, and marked as done by the workers once the current file has finished and there is nothing
# else left in the queue. Bit of a hack to pass the raw Net::Async:HTTP objects but since they each stringify to a different
# value it does the job for now, should perhaps pass an ID or something instead.
